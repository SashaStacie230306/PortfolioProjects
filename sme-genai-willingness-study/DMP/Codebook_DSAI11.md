## Project Description

This research examines the factors influencing employees' willingness to learn generative AI tools in SMEs, focusing on departments, sector, education level, and demographics.

##Study design and data processing

The aim is to obtain industry insights from conducting an online survey through
’Prolific.com’. This platform offers a quick and effective solution to directly target the SME employees (population)
who are active on Prolific (sample). After analysing the data from the survey, interviews will be conducted with SME
employees to look for specific reasons as to why differences were present or not.


## Data Collection and Clearning
###Collection of the raw data
Data is to be collected from a conducted online survey through ’Prolific.com'. Participants self-reported on their willingness to learn about generative AI, SME size, and other relevant factors.

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
This section here is not applicable at the moment because the survey has not been conducted yet; all data will be hypothetical until the actual responses are gathered.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
The description is not applicale at the moment. However,, talking hypothetically in the cleaning script our team will remove incomplete responses, recodes SME size categories into uniform intervals, and standardizes responses for willingness to learn about AI.

## Variables
##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
